			<h1>New partnerships for new funding</h1>
			<p>Winning contracts has traditionally been an area where the VCS struggled, so we made it a priority.  With our support, groups build consortia and submitted bids with £14.1 last year. We also helped 13 VCS groups come together, form a consortium and win £3.3 million in funding for domestic and sexual violence services.</p>
